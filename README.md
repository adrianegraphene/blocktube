YouTube can be a time sink. Here's a list of keywords that I, personally, have had to block because the YT algorithm is just too good and will ruin my productivity if I let it. My saddest addition to this list = "cats" & "dogs". My most embarrasing additions = "Dick Tracy" & "Don Draper".

Hope this helps you boost your own productivity!

I use similar things for LinkedIn with "LinkOff" extension and use Twitter's built-in keywords
